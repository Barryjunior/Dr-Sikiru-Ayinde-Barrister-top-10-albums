    <h2> 'His Top 10 Classy Albums' </h2>
    
      <h1>10. Family Planning</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/download (8).jpg">
      </div>
      <br/>
      Family Planning was released in 1981.It is an album where the legend sang about the importance of family, why the need of a family planning is required in every family.He sang about the role a father should always play and also the children.In the second track, he went on and praised himself and why people should respect him more and also he praised the popular late Oba of Oyo. I think if you are looking for one of his albums to listen to, family planning is one of them, it comes at 10th.
      <h1>9. Ore lope</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/images.jpg">
      </div>
      <br/>
      Also released in 1981, Ore lope is a great album that speaks about the importance of being grateful and also showing kindness. The fuji legend narrated a story of a Lion, a hunter and an Old woman who once lived together, how the woman helped the lion but later got betrayed.Mr fuji is well known for his story-telling that speaks wisdom and knowledge,this tale was a great one from him. He then took us on another story in the second track reminding the Muslims the story of one of the holy prophets and why they should always keep to their promise.The great concept behind this album and the way Alhaji Agba narrated the tales and stories showed how brilliant and insightful he was. With no doubt, this album comes at 9.
      <h1>8. DEMOCRACY</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/democracy.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: auto;"></div>
      <br/>
      Released in 1992, The album came out during a time when Nigeria was dealing with many political and social issues (military rule, transitions, etc.). Ayinde Balogun made sure the coming generations understood their root, he sang about the past leaders of Nigeria from 1960 when Nigeria gained independence, the people that fought for it and how different leaders spent their tenures, how Empires rose and fell, how power was passed and taken, how he wants a better Nigeria. While Barrister expressed support for both military and democratic institutions at different times, his advocacy always boiled down to one goal: good governance—“Let there be food on the table of everybody..." the same way we gave birth to kings, is the same way slaves were born.This album is considered one of the best albums released by the Fuji legend, It comes at 8. 
      <h1>7. Wisdom and Correction</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/wisdom.jpg"> </div>
      <br/>
      By 2004, Alhaji Agba was already an established Fuji legend. This album continues his tradition of combining musical entertainment with moral or social commentary.Having released in 2004,He sang about people knowing their place — e.g., elders vs juniors, the king vs the palace chief, the slave vs the free person. Wrongful arrogance or disregarding of order is criticized. On this album, he took us back to 1960 right to where and how Fuji music started with him, how he reformed the famous were music into fuji. He earned his rights and made it known he transformed the were music into fuji, he claimed the record was made to set record straight, for the coming generations to know how fuji started and why he should be reffered to as the Fuji Creator.The songs serve as admonishment, he asks whether to speak or stay silent. There’s a sense of moral duty to correct, even when it’s difficult.It comes at 7.
      <h1>6. OKE AGBA</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/WhatsApp Image 2025-08-06 at 10.41.25_bc8db01e.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></div>
      <br/>
      Oke agba was released in the year 1980. This album was one of the best records released in that year, and it is still quite popular till date. In this album, the former Sergent Sikiru sang about his time in the millitary, not just any soldier but one that has seen war and fought it. He joined the Nigerian army on 24th of february,1968 at Abeokuta, he narrated how he commuted from lokoja to benue to enugu then to onitsha where they fought in a war. 
      <p>On this album,he took us through his millitary time before he was discharged in 1976 to face his Music carreer.He also narrated how he was arrested after being accused of Murder.He didn't stop there, he went on by dissing the popular Olabisi Ajala where he claimed the promoter was an extort,According to statements by Barrister’s associates, Ajala was making “too many demands” — asking/pushing for more than what Barrister felt was reasonable or fair. Barrister saw Ajala’s behaviour as exploitative and narrated how his success came about and not because of Olabisi Ajala. He sang about how succesful he was and how he has rightfully attained the Upper throne.This track was said to be Barrister’s way of “liberating himself” from Ajala’s “blackmail” or excessive demands. This album is one of the best he ever made but unfortunately it comes at 6th.</p>      
      <h1>5. Suru Baba Iwa</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/suru.jpg"></div>
      <br/>
      At Number 5, we have Suru Baba Iwa, This album was released during his early-to-mid Fuji era, when the genre was consolidating and becoming more mainstream in Yoruba and wider Nigerian popular music culture.This was another breakout song from the Legend, after a short break and controversies, the Legend released this album where he preached about Patience and also told a tale about the Monkey who wanted to become human but couldn't due to lack of patience.As earlier stated, Mr fuji is well known for his tales and stories, this was yet another great story-telling album from the legend, he also preached to people why patience is virtue. 
      <h1>4. Image and Gratitude</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/image and gratitude.jpg"></div>
      <br/>
      This was the last album that was made by the Fuji king. This album was released in 2008 under Barry Black Music.This album was made as a reflection of his career and also an expression of gratitude.
      <br />
      The album features 3 songs. There's also a sequel, "Image & Gratitude II", released with 4 songs on some platforms, but 3 songs on others. Unfortunately , this album statement was his last, Given when it was released (2007-2008), this is in Barrister’s later career, a period where he often reflected more, showed gratitude, perhaps responded to critics or events in his life and career.He went on by praising everyone right from when he started to everyone that was involved in his journey, to everyone who called him for shows and to everyone who bought his music and loved him. This album comes at 4th.
      <h1>3. Fuji Garbage</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/fuji garbage.jpg"></div>
      <br/>
      The Fuji Garbage. I believe almost everyone,young and old, male or female danced to fuji garbage when it came out. Another hit album from Ayinde Balogun that took every streets,every corner of the country. He made 3 series of the album known as Series 1,2 and 3 and also the refined fuji Garbage.<br /> 
      
      The Fuji Garbage series marked a pivotal shift in Nigeria’s music scene—outshining even disco in popularity, and reshaping the landscape of Fuji music by influencing other artists and ushering in new sub-genres like Fuji-influenced Afrojuju.
      If you are looking to dance away and feel alive, this album was made for you, This album won the hearts of many and even if some might say it is the best album from the Legend, we believe it comes at 3rd.
      <h1>2. Reality</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/reality.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <br/>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The album was released 2004."Reality," delves into deeply personal themes—a familial struggle where Barrister articulates tension and misunderstanding with his siblings, arising largely from financial pressures and unmet expectations.it is a significant part of his extensive discography that is stil well played around the world till date. This album is a one in all and even though the song reality itself was a message record of how illed he was, the record still has a danceable beat to it.Musically, the track remains rooted in authentic Fuji tradition, blending narrative lyricism with the rhythmic prowess he was known for, delivering a message that’s both emotionally charged and culturally grounded.. He also went on by praaising Oba rilwan of lagos in the second track. I believe everyone would agree with me that this album comes at second.</p>
      <br/>
      <h1 style="text-align: left;">1. AIYE</h1>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./image/aiye.jpg"></div>
      <br/>
      <p style="text-align: left;">At number 1, we have Aiye. Aiye is our number 1 song from over 120 albums released by the fuji king.The album was released in 1980, where the legend toured the city of Orlando in Florida, USA with his friend Buhari Olooto.The fuji man came back home and sang how amazed he was on his tour in florida at Disney world.After many praises to the Whites, the singer urged the Nigerian and its Government to improve the state of the country by loving one another and following the steps of the Whites.This track won him many awards even from the White people having recognized the great music of the Legend.<br/> Also, the second track shouldn't be left out, in this track, the man sang a tribute to Ayinla omo wura who was accidentally killed by his manager, the loss of Ayinla, a friend and mentor to Ayinde,it came as a great shock to him because even some might have accused him for killing the popular musician then before it was resolved and the fuji musician poured out his mind fully on this track and paid tribute to him. If you are looking for the best album from the legend, Aiye is that album. Thank you for reading.</p>
